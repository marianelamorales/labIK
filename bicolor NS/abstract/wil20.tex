\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
	We present a nested sequent system for intuitionistic modal logic in which we capture explicitly two relations: one for the accessibility relation associated with the Kripke semantics for normal modal logics (represented with one bracket in a formula or context) and one for the preorder relation associated with the Kripke semantics for intuitionistic logic (represented with two brackets in a formula or context).
