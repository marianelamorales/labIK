This abstract discussed ongoing work on extending labelled deduction
a larger class of logics.  In particular, they study logics using a
bi-relational semantics and explicit accessibility and preorder
relations. The inference rules reflect the definitions nicely.  I
would have liked to see more motivation for these particular kinds of
proof systems in general.

Sounds like an interesting topic but I do not have the background to evaluate its novelty.

----------- Overall evaluation -----------
This is very interesting work on "modal correspondence theory" for intuitionistic modal logic.It builds on the authors' previous work on proof-theoretical study of modal logics, in particular connecting it to other recent developments in deep inference.  While the rules discussed in the short abstract seem very sensible, I do not know how much has been done so far towards the goal of a full correspondence theory for the logics in the cube of modal logics. Definitely looking forward to the talk.
