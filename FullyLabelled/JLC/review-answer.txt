Dear Didier,

thank you very much for the reviews. We are very grateful to the
reviewers for their helpful comments, which enabled us to considerably
improve our paper.

We took all comments and remarks into account, and below we address
the reviewers comments in detail.

One of the main concerns of Reviewer 1 is that we have not cited all
the relevant literature. We thank the reviewer for pointing out the
missing references and added them accordingly.

We now address the other comments:

We already said in the submitted version that in our system
contraction is derivable from the monotonicity rules, which in turn
are admissible. We made this even more clear in the new version in
Remark XXXXX.

In fact, the contracted instances are added. In the same way as for
other rules, occurring labels can be equal. We failed to make this
explicit in the first submitted version and corrected that mistake in
Remark XXXXXXXXXX

If something works best for A, it does not mean that it won't work for
B. All we tried to say was that for logics with the standard Kripke
semantics there is this close relationship between the semantics and
the labels in the proof system.

We never claim the birelational semantics to be a novelty (it goes
back to the 1980s). Our paper is not about semantics but about about
proof systems. And our system allows for extenstions that could not be
studied before. We made this more clear in the new version (see
Section 7).

We are puzzled by this comment, as we just picked the standard
semantics for intuitionistic modal logic, and semantics is not a
concern of our paper. However, we added in the conclusion some
comments on constructive modal logics, which are another variant of
adding BOX and DIAMOND to intuitionistic propositional logic.



Reviewer 2 finds this paper well written, but has some technical
concerns. We address them below.

We added Remark 7.5 to discuss this. Our rules are in fact in the
style of Simpson, but we added a comparison to Vigano's method.

We fixed that.

We just removed the "need".
