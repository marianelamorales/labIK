Dear Sonia Marin,  Marianela Morales, and Lutz Strassburger,

We are pleased to announce that your paper

A fully labelled proof system for intuitionistic modal logics

is accepted for publication in the Special Issue of the JLC on External
and Internal Calculi for Non Classical Logics.

You have addressed the comments by the reviewers in your new version
but they propose some additional improvements for the final version.
These improvements are at the end of this message (after Editors of
EICNCL.............).
We ask you to take them into account for the final version.

Could you send me the final source files (if possible only one .tex file
and the corresponding generated .pdf file) of your final paper no later
than 15 January 2021.

We thank you again for your submission to this  Special Issue of JLC.

Best wishes,

Agata Ciabattoni, Didier Galmiche, Nicola Olivetti, and Revantha Ramanayake
Editors of the EICNCL Special Issue of JLC

Requested improvements:

The authors have addressed the comments by the referee, but in a way 
that still
leaves some room for improvement. I will now list (in order of 
appearance in the
paper) such issues.


p. 2 The authors write: "In order to address these two concerns we 
propose here
to enrich usual labelled sequents by allowing both, relational atoms of 
the form
x ≤ y and of the form xRy"


This has already been donein the paper by Maffezioli, Naibo and Negri. 
There is
also another paper that considers such additions for 
intuitionisticmulti-modal logic
with applications to decision procedures:


D. Garg, V. Genovese, and S. Negri, Countermodels from sequent calculi 
in multi-modal
logics. LICS 2012, IEEE Computer Society, pp. 315–324, 2012.


So a better formulation would be one that doesn't suggest that 
consideration of the
alethic accessibility replation with the intuitionistic preorder is a 
novelty of the present
paper:


"As done earlier in the literatureon intuitionistic modal logic (cf....) 
we consider here
to enrich"



We also find that the followingsentence is unclear:


"A system similar to ours is presented in [MNN13], for intuitionistic 
bimodal epistemic logic.
That system is also a multi-conclusion labelled system with more than 
one relation. In fact,
the logical rules are essentially the same as ours, but we use a more 
general setting and
provide deductive proof systems for a larger class of intuitionistic 
modal logics, together
with an internal cut elimination procedure."

More specifically, it is not clear what the authors mean by"internal cut 
elimination procedure".
At the beginning of the paper "internal calculi" are identified as those 
calculi, such as hypersequent
or nested calculi, that do not have explicit accessibility relations. 
But then in which sense it the
  cut elimination "internal"? Is it because there are no cuts on 
relational atoms? This is the case
also for the mentioned MNN paper.Please clarify.


Theorem 3.3 refers to formulas but a sequent calculus derives, in fact, 
sequents. In a Gentzen
sequent calculus a sequent can be translated into a formula, and 
conversely, but this is no
longer the case in a labelled calculus because of the labelling and the 
relational atoms.
1,4 and 2,3 refer, respectively, to formulas and to labelled formulas, 
so they cannot be equivalent.
Observe also that the paper byMaffezioli, Naibo and Negri prove 
completeness wrt sequents,
not just wrt formulas, so it presents a more general approach.

One of the main contributions of the mentioned paper by Maffezioli, 
Naibo and Negri seems to be
the proof-theoretical analysis for an extension with a frame property 
that does not fall under the
class of geometric implications and that requires an extension of the 
usual methodology. In fact,
their paper presents the first example of the method of "system of 
rules", later systematized in :

S. Negri. Proof analysis beyond geometric theories: from rule systems to 
systems of rules.Journal of Logic and Computation,
vol. 27, pp. 513-537, 2016.

The frame properties and rules considered in the paper under review are 
all of the geometric form,
so it would be more correct to say that it is an in-depth study of 
intuitionistic modal logic for a larger
class of geometric frame properties rather than a generalization of the 
results in the paper by
Maffezioli,  Naibo and Negri.


Section 7, with consideration of the Scott-Lemmon axioms seems to be the 
most original part
of the paper.


In references, book and thesestitles should be capitalized (this is not 
done consistently).


Observe that the cited paper


Tiziano Dalmonte, Charles Grellois, and Nicola Olivetti. Intuitionistic 
non-normal modal logics:
A general framework. CoRR, abs/1901.09812, 2019.


has in the meanwhile been published in the JPL.
